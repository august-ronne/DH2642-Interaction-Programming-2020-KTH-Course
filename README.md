#### About the Course ####
[Visit course page at KTH.se][https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/DH2642]
The course aims to teach students to develop interactive web applications, with the main focus being the application frontend and its user interactions.
The coursework consists of four labs and a more extensive project. Both the labs and the projects are carried out in pairs.

Some of the course contents listed at its introductory page are:
* JavaScript for interaction programming, callbacks, synchronous and asynchronous code, functional programming.
* Web development interfaces (API): REST, JSON, AJAX, Fetch, Promises.
* Local data: cookies, local storage.
* User interfaces, appearance: HTML, CSS, DOM API, other tree based frameworks for user interfaces (e g Android).
* User interfaces, interaction: events, event levels, event propagation, event management.
* User interfaces, architectures: Model-View-Controller.
* User interfaces, frameworks: React, or Angular, or Vue (student's choice).

The learning outcomes are as follows:
* choose appropriate technical platforms or JavaScript frameworks to create useful data persistent interactive web applications or native applications
* program interactive web applications according to Model-View-Controller or related architectures
* program systems that read data from, and send data to, web interfaces with good use qualities
* assess and improve the usability of existing interactive web applications
* cooperate with others to implement interactive web applications.
